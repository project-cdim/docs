#### 3.1. Check and Change Log Output Methods 
##### 3.1.1. Check Logs
By default, logs are output to the following location. However, they are retained within the container, so ensure to manage their storage appropriately.
```sh
$ docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/sh
$ ls /var/log/cdim
```
Logs are organized by component into the following files:

| Log Type | Log File Name |
|:--|:--|
| Audit Log | trail.log |
| Application Log (Hardware Control) | app_hw_control.log |
| Application Log (Layout Application) | app_layout_apply.log |
| Application Log (Migration Procedure Generation) | app_migration_procedures.log |
| Application Log (Configuration Information Management) | app_config_info.log |

##### 3.1.2. Change Log Output Methods
To modify the log output settings, update the settings file corresponding to each component. The settings files are located as follows:

| Component Name | Settings File Name | File Path |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Audit Log (Performance Information Collection) | main.go | performance-collector-compose/performance-collector/performance-collector |
| Audit Log (Performance Information Exporter) | main.go | performance-exporter-compose/performance-exporter/performance-exporter |
| Audit Log (Configuration Information Collection) | run_collect.go | configuration-collector-compose/configuration-collector/configuration-collector/cmd |
| Audit Log (Configuration Information Exporter) | main.go | configuration-exporter-compose/configuration-exporter/configuration-exporter |
| Audit Log (Configuration Information Management) | main.go | configuration-manager-compose/configuration-manager/configuration-manager |
| Hardware Control | settings.py | hw-control-compose/hw-control/src/app/common |
| Layout Application | layoutapply_config.yaml | layout-apply-compose/layout-apply/src/layoutapply/config |
| Migration Procedure Generation | migrationprocedures_config.yaml | migration-procedure-generator-compose/migration-procedure-generator/src/migrationproceduregenerator/config |
| Performance Information Collection | logger.go | performance-collector-compose/performance-collector/performance-collector/internal/service |
| Performance Information Exporter | logger.go | performance-exporter-compose/performance-exporter/performance-exporter/internal/service |
| Configuration Information Collection | collect_logger.go | configuration-collector-compose/configuration-collector/configuration-collector/service |
| Configuration Information Exporter | controller_common.go | configuration-exporter-compose/configuration-exporter/configuration-exporter/controller |
| Configuration Information Management | gi_cm_applog.go | configuration-manager-compose/configuration-manager/configuration-manager/common |

The settings for log output files are as follows. For settings files in Go format, write the following items in the code.
| Setting Item | Description |
|:--|:--|
| tag | Tag representing the component |
| log_dir | Log output directory |
| log_file | Log file name |
| logging_level | Logging level. Logs above the set level are output |
| rotation_size | File size (bytes) for log rotation |
| backup_files | Number of backup files to retain through rotation |
| stdout | If true, logs are also output to standard output |

After modifying the settings, restart the component using [this procedure](../appendix/troubleshooting/README.md#4-restart-a-specific-component).

> [!NOTE]
> If the component fails to run after changing the log output directory, you may need to create the directory beforehand. Adjust the Dockerfile accordingly to create the log output directory.

#### 3.2. Change Information Collection Settings 
Modify the settings file of each collection component to adjust the collection interval and other parameters.

Configuration Information Collection: configuration-collector-compose/configuration-collector/configuration-collector/config/collect.yaml

```yaml
hw_collect_configs:
  - job_name: 'Hardware-Sync'
    interval: 600   # Configuration information retrieval interval (s)
    timeout: 600    # Configuration information timeout value (s)
```
After modifying the setting, restart the component.  
Refer to [this procedure](../appendix/troubleshooting/README.md#4-restart-a-specific-component) for the restart.

Performance Information Collection: performance-collector-compose/share/prometheus.yml

```yaml
global:
    evaluation_interval: 180s  # Performance information retrieval interval (s)
    scrape_interval: 180s      # Performance information timeout value (s)
```

For performance information collection, you need to restart the information collection.
```sh
$ docker exec -it performance-collector /bin/sh
$ curl -i -s -X PUT http://localhost:8080/cdim/api/v1/configs
```

#### 3.3. Change User Authentication Methods and Permissions
> [!NOTE]
> Keycloak is used for authentication.  
> For details, refer to the [official documentation (English version)](https://www.keycloak.org/documentation).

##### 3.3.1. Add Users

1. Access the Keycloak master URL for CDIM user management and log in
   - **When using the user management screen:**  
     Log in with an account that has `cdim-manage-user` permissions (such as Administrator) and navigate to User Management/User List.  
     Click "Admin Console" in the upper right and log in.
     ![](imgs/user-dashboard.png)

   - **When using the Keycloak management URL:**  
     Follow the instructions in [getting started](../../../getting-started/en/setup/setup.md#2-frontend) to log in directly to the Keycloak management screen.  
     After logging in, switch to the CDIM management screen by changing the dropdown list in the upper left from Keycloak to CDIM.

> [!NOTE]
> If you access via the user management screen and encounter a "We are sorry" error, it is not an issue.  
> Click "Back to Application" to proceed to the CDIM management URL.

> [!NOTE]
> Also, users without the cdim-administrator role can transition to the user management screen, but cannot make changes such as adding users.

1. To add users:
   - Click "Users" in the menu on the left and then click the "Add User" button.
   ![](imgs/user-console-keycloak.png)
