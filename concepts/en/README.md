# Concepts

## Our Goal

In recent years, a variety of hardware vendors have introduced Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure (CDI). This technology enables dynamic reconfiguration of connections between servers (CPU nodes) and various devices like Memory (CXL Memory), GPUs, FPGAs, and NVMe SSDs via PCI Express/CXL switches. Leveraging CDI, it is possible to efficiently configure, reconfigure, and dismantle nodes based on workload demands, thus optimizing hardware utilization.

However, managing hundreds or thousands of CDI configuration resources (such as CPUs, Memory, GPUs, FPGAs, NVMe SSDs) in large-scale environments poses significant challenges for instant configuration control and automation.

To overcome these challenges, our ultimate goal is to deliver a unified platform through Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure Manager (CDIM). This platform aims to automatically design and reconfigure an optimal system architecture for various workloads, operating independently of the client implementations at the upper layer and the hardware or fabric at the lower layer.

## Our Scope

To realize CDIM's ultimate goal, we envision necessary functionalities. These functionalities, which we aim to implement in this project to fulfill our objectives, are:

1. An interface for integrated/common management of heterogeneous hardware.
2. A framework for the automatic design and implementation of node configurations optimized for workloads.
3. Integrated system control that includes existing software such as OpenStack and Kubernetes.

Currently, we only provide the functionality for "an interface for integrated/common management of heterogeneous hardware." For more details on the roadmap for additional functionalities, please refer to our [Roadmap][].

## Architecture

The diagram below represents the current architecture.
Based on this, we will further develop components and interface specifications to incorporate the as-yet unimplemented functionalities outlined in [Our Scope][].

![ModuleDiagram][]

Features implemented by CDIM are colored blue, and those relying on other OSS are marked in orange. Additionally, while not shown in the diagram, Dapr is utilized for service integration.

Function descriptions are as follows:

> [!NOTE]
> In CDI terminology, individual devices are called "resources," and the computational execution platform formed by combining these resources is called a "compute node."
