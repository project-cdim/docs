# Roadmap

The release schedule post-April 1, 2025, is in the planning stages. This document will be updated as soon as the schedule is finalized.

As of March 28, 2025, we have successfully implemented the first phase of functionalities outlined in our [Scope](../../concepts/en/README.md#our-scope):

1. An interface for integrated/common management of heterogeneous hardware.

Beginning April 1, 2025, we aim to expand and enhance the functionalities currently available. Our roadmap includes the gradual deployment of the following capabilities:

2. A framework for the automatic design and implementation of node configurations optimized for workloads.
3. Integrated system control that includes existing software such as OpenStack and Kubernetes.

This progressive enhancement approach ensures that we not only meet the existing infrastructure demands but also adapt to evolving technologies and requirements.
